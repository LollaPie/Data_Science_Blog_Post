## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Necessary libraries are: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Plotly Express.  Python versions 3.0 or higher is needed.


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is a capstone project for the Udacity Nanodegree in Data Science. I investigated Airbnb Data from Seattle in 2016 to answer the following questions:

1. Which features of the homestays correlate with the price?
2. What are the most popular neighbourhoods in Seattle according to the Airbnb data?
3. What is the best time in the year to visit Seattle?


The data sets used in the project are owned by Airbnb.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook availble here which was used to do all the calculation and plotting. The main data set used was "listings.csv", which contains all data about all listings on Airbnb in this period for Seattle. Furthermore "calendar.csv" was used to calculate the acutal pricing for each booking and to get the availability of each homestay during the year.

The files also contain the '.png' file of each plot used for the final blog post on Medium.  


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the project can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).

First of all I must give credit to Udacity for providing this great course. Then of course Airbnb and kaggle to provide the data. You can find the data used in the project [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle). The latest data from Airbnb can be download directly from Airbnb [here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
